## About Me

Hi, **_I’m Andy Parry_**.  An experienced technology leader, coach, and avid cyclist with a passion for driving change, fostering growth, and building meaningful connections. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of leading transformative initiatives in technology, delivering innovative solutions, and creating high-performing teams that thrive on collaboration and adaptability.

My roles have ranged from driving Agile transformations to implementing cutting-edge data strategies and mentoring diverse teams to deliver business success. With a particular focus on emerging technologies like generative AI and cloud computing, I aim to bridge the gap between innovation and real-world application.

Coaching and mentoring are integral to who I am. Whether it’s guiding teams toward professional excellence or helping individuals unlock their potential, I take pride in fostering growth and a culture of continuous learning.
When I’m not in a strategy meeting or leading a project, you’ll likely find me on two wheels, racing through trails or enjoying a weekend ride. Cycling mirrors much of what I value in life - perseverance, balance, and the thrill of pushing boundaries.
