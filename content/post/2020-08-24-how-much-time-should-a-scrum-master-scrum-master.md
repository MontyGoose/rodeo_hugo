 This has become a bit of a hot topic for me recently ..... it's an interesting
  question. We don't typically ask, how much time should a developer be a

The simple knee jerk answer would be to state, that as a role, this is what you do.... so all the time. But I don't believe that is right now that simple?


I found this great survey ... https://dzone.com/articles/scrum-master-duties-what-are-you-doing-all-day-sur - which helps as it means I don't need to make it up!
It's worth a read .. but the conclusion from over 200 Scrum Masters was;

## Survey

### Scrum Master Duties: Doing the Math
A typical Scrum team based on this survey has more than seven members and runs a two-week sprint.
On average, the team's Scrum Master allocates his or her time roughly as follows, normalized to hours per week:
* Product backlog refinement: 1.00 hours/week
* Sprint planning: 0.75 hours/week
* Stand-ups: 1.50 hours/week
* Sprint review: 0.50 hours/week
* Sprint retrospective: 0.75 hours/week
* Learning: 2.00 hours/week
* Training of teammates: 3.00 hours/week
* Training of stakeholders: 2.00 hours/week

If you do the math â€” the total amount of time spent on Scrum ceremonies, educating herself, or training teammates and stakeholders, respectively, is about 11.50 hours/week.

So 11 1/2 hours ..... but then I looked at two parts

### The numbers
The times above are based on 'an average of what they do' and not on 'what they should do' - these numbers are low for how Scrum Guides define the
timeboxed activities, and low for how I see the time too....
I'd suggest something more like
* Product backlog refinement: 2.00 hours/week
* Sprint planning: 1 hours/week
* Stand-ups: 1.50 hours/week
* Sprint review: 0.50 hours/week
* Sprint retrospective: 0.75 hours/week
Not a massive change but our time is now up to .... 12hr 45 mins / week,

Are we done .. I don't think so ... isn't there more a Scrum Master can / should be doing?
### What are we missing
Here's some
* Working on impediments
* Preparing for meetings/events
* Gather Agile metrics and prepare reports.
* Meeting with other SMs - Scrum Guild
* Ensuring Jira / physical board is up to date
* .. ...

This is really hard to put a figure too - and some could be contained in "learning, training" above .... but we could conservatively put 2hrs 15 mins on this
.... (make my numbers better)

So we have a revised total of AT LEAST 15 hours .....

Agree / Disagree? ..... it's 50% of a working week - when I look at how important the Scrum Master role is for the success of the team - it seems about
right to me.
